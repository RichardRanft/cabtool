This just wraps makecab.exe and expand.exe to make them slightly more friendly to use.

-source  required - source file or folder to add, or the cab to extract

-target  (optional) name of cab file if adding, target folder for extracting

-a       add file(s) or a folder.

-x       extract file(s) to -target, or to the current folder if no target

Must provide -a or -x, and a -source

-a and -x are mutually exclusive.
